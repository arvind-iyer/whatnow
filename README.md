### 1. Maybe you'd like to experiment with writing HTML with freedom and none of the problems that come with setting up?
Go sign up on [codepen.io](http://codepen.io/) (yes they have a free plan as well, they just have it below the paid options when you try to sign up)
..Codepen is a fun and easy to use playground for front-end web design. It makes writing and sharing front-end code easy and fast
